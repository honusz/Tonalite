# Welcome to the Tonalite v1.0.0 Documentation!

This book will show you how to get started using Tonalite to create great lighting quickly and easily.

### Who is Tonalite for?

Tonalite is for schools and smaller venues who need a solid multi-purpose lighting control application on a budget. It is designed to work with industry standard hardware, and it is meant to be as easy to use as possible.

### What is Tonalite meant to do?

Tonalite is supposed to be used with theater systems that have very little or no moving lights. This makes it great for facilities with outdated lighting rigs. Tonalite outputs up to 48 chanels of E1.31 (sACN) DMX data which should be sufficient for many use cases. This number can always be increased if needed.
