Artnet and ACN receiver for uDMX

This archive contains several executables:
- uDMXArtnet.exe for Windows and
- uDMXArtnet for Linux-32-bit
- uDMXArtnet_64 and uDMXArtnet_minimal_64 for Linux-64-bit
- uDMXArtnet_PI_32 and uDMXArtnet_PI_minimal_32 for Raspberry-Pi

The *minimal* versions are command-line versions that you can start in rc.local on boot-time for example

To start the programs extract them to your favorite folder and then:
- just start uDMXArtnet.exe on Windows
- make uDMXArtnet* executable and then start it.

As too many clones appeared in the last years (see X-uDMX512, uDMX512, ...), 
that removed copyright information, i dont publish source any more.
