// === CHANGELOG

21.07.2017
  o changed libusb-0.1.12.2 to libusb-1.0.21 -> less LIBUSB_ERROR_OVERFLOW errors
		now uDMXArtnet for Windows needs WinUSB driver (not libusbK driver)		

18.07.2017
  o different actions on different usb errors  (reconnect not always neccessary)

15.07.2017
  o show dimmer output values in different color if they are different from received values
  o repair trace. not need for several va_list in another

04.07.2017
  o support for magiqc dimmercurveuser<N>.csv files in combination with dmxchannel2dimmercurve.csv

01.07.2017
  o 64bit version for linux
  o minimal version for PI (32bit)

19.04.2016
  o first version for PI published

12.04.2016
  o improved help with more tooltips, show command line parameters in <Info>

25.03.2016
  o better error handling if no multicast able device (for ACN) is found 
  o new parameter <-n> for easier support of several uDMX devices without the need of different serial number
    use: <uDMXArtnet -n 1> opens the first uDMX
         <uDMXArtnet -n 2> opens the second uDMX
    but keep in mind: unplugging and plugging uDMX to another usb-port might change the orders
    so using <uDMXArtnet -s ...> is more secure if you have different serial numbers

23.03.2016
  o new test page for testing first 10 channels without any receiving necessary

22.03.2016
  o show refresh-rate in progress-bar

19.03.2016
  o algorithm to optimize transfer time to uDMX
  o show refresh-rate (transfers to uDMX per second) with verbose >= 8

18.03.2016
  o new visualisation of dmx channels. much more channels than 20 (as in old version) are shown
	o every 10th channel gets different color, every 100th as well, for faster overview

15.03.2016
  o (S)ACN / E1.17 / E1.31 protocol implemented
    uDMXArtnet starts listening on artnet and acn 

27.05.2009
  o Artnet restarts if user selects wrong ip
  o Verbose, Universe, TimeBreak, TimeMark change without saving
  
xx.05.2009
  o initial release
