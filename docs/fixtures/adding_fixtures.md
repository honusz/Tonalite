# Adding Fixtures

Add a fixture using the green `Add Fixture` button on the top of the `Fixtures` tab. This will open a modal that shows the available fixture profiles and allows you to set a starting DMX address for the fixture. Each channel's DMX address is based off of the starting DMX address. If the fixture has three channels and the starting DMX address is 1, the channels will be mapped to addresses 1, 2, and 3.

To select a fixture profile, click on it in the list, and a new fixture will be created based on this profile.
