# Using Fixtures

Any production uses a number of different lighting fixtures. Tonalite allow you to control each one individually and set the values of each of its channels separately. You can access the fixtures in the fixtures tab of the interface.

Each fixture is dislayed as a blue box with the fixture's short name on it.
