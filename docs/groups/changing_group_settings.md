## Buttons

### Back

Go back to the group's parameters.

### Save

Save the changes you have made to the group. Make sure you do this every time you make a change or your edits won't apply!

### Delete

Remove the group from the show. You will be prompted to make sure you really want to do this.

## Inputs

### Name

The full name of the group. This can be any length needed to be descriptive though we suggest that you keep it short so as to fit into the interface easily.
