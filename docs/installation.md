# Installing Tonalite

To install Tonalite, download `tonalite-*version*.zip` and unpack it to somewhere on your computer. This location can be anywhere that has permissions to run application files. It is often easiest to put it in either the *Documents* or *Desktop* folder.

### Starting the Application

To start Tonalite, run `tonalite-*version*/Tonalite.exe`. Once you have done this, a web browser window will open with the Tonalite login screen.
