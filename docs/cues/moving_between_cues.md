## Left

Transition to the cue directly before the current or last-played cue. If no cue has been played or the last cue played was the first in the list, the last cue in the list will be played.

## Right

Transition to the cue directly after the current or last-played cue. If no cue has been played or the last cue played was the last in the list, the first cue in the list will be played.

## Stop
