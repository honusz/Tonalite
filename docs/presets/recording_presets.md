# Record Presets

Record a preset using the green `Record Preset` button on the top of the `Presets` tab. Note that a preset stores the current output DMX values, and not output fixtures. This is so that presets will still work even if you don't have some or all fixtures needed for the preset in the current show. A preset will only override DMX output parameters when the channel saved in the preset has a higher value that the current channel.
