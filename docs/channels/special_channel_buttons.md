# Special Channel Buttons

On the keyboard, you will see some other, more specific buttons that affect channel values.

## Full

This button provides an easier way to enter full strength for the selected channel values. Instead of entering the number `100` (for 100%) manually, just press the *Full* button and `100` will be entetred for you.

## Dim

The *Dim* button takes the selected channel values and lowers them by 10%.

If Channel 5 is currently at 80% and you would like to bring it down slightly to 70%, press:

`Channel` + `5` + `At` + `Dim`

## Bright

The *Bright* button takes the selected channel values and increases them by 10%.

If Channel 5 is currently at 70% and you would like to increase it slightly to 80%, press:

`Channel` + `5` + `At` + `Bright`

## Release

When you set channel values in the *Keyboard* tab, the values overwrite all other channel values set by *Cues* and *Submasters*. The *Release* button removes all the inputted values and allows the other functions to edit the channel values. *Note that only specific values entered in the Keyboard tab will overwite the Cues and Submasters.*
For example, if you set the values of Channels 1 through 5 in *Keyboard*, the values of Channels 6 through 48 will still be controlled by *Cues* and *Submasters*.
