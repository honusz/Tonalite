# Welcome to the Tonalite v2.0.0 Beta 2 Documentation!

This book will show you how to get started using Tonalite to create professional lighting quickly and easily.

### Who Is Tonalite For?

Tonalite is for theater venues who need a lighting control system. It is designed to work with industry-standard hardware, and is meant to be as easy to use as possible.

### What Is Tonalite Meant to Do?

Tonalite is meant to control lighting rigs using a web interface accessible from any device on the network such as a phone, tablet, or laptop. This allows the operator to control lighting while moving throughout the theater. You can still use it with a wired connection in case of connection issues.
